# DevRel Role Takehome Exercise

**Role:** Developer Relations Engineer

**Estimated Time:** ~5–7 hours

**Goal:** Assess your ability to **build with the Yellow SDK, document it**, and **communicate technical concepts** effectively. The following exercise is designed to evaluate your ability to:

- Understand **Yellow SDK**’s purpose and usage
- Build a **small demo app** using the SDK
- Write **clear developer-facing documentation**
- Showcase **communication skills** by explaining technical concepts
- Optionally create **content** (blog/video) to demonstrate DevRel aptitude

## **Context**

Yellow SDK is a developer toolkit that simplifies building decentralized applications on top of the **Yellow Network**. As a DevRel Engineer, you’ll help developers understand how to integrate the SDK, troubleshoot issues, and **create engaging technical content**.

This exercise simulates a typical scenario: you’ll explore the SDK, build a small integration, and produce developer-friendly documentation.

## **The Tasks**

### **1. Explore the Yellow SDK**

- Review the SDK’s documentation and example code.
- Understand its main features:
    - Authentication
    - Connecting to the Yellow Network
    - Create app sessions and use transfers

*Deliverable:* A short summary (`SUMMARY.md`, ~200–300 words) describing:

- What the SDK does
- Key modules/features
- One potential use case where it shines

### **2. Build a Mini Demo App**

Create a simple app with the Yellow SDK that can be used to showcase its advantages.

**Requirements:**

- Keep it small and focused (≤200 lines of code recommended).
- Use **Golang** or **TypeScript** (preferred).
- Include a `README.md` with setup instructions and usage examples.

### **3. Write Developer-Friendly Documentation**

- Add a short **“Getting Started” guide** (`GETTING_STARTED.md`, ~500 words).
- Explain:
    - How to install and configure the SDK
    - How to authenticate
    - How to run your demo app

This is your chance to **show your technical writing skills**.

### **4. Create Developer-Focused Content** *(Optional, Bonus)*

- Record a **2–3 minute video walkthrough** **OR** write a **blog-style article** introducing the SDK and your demo app.
- Imagine you’re publishing it for the Yellow developer community.
- Focus on clarity, developer empathy, and engaging storytelling.

## **Submission Guidelines**

- Push your solution to a **public GitHub repository**.
- The repo should include:
    - `SUMMARY.md`
    - Demo app source code
    - `README.md`
    - `GETTING_STARTED.md`
    - *(Optional)* blog/video link
- Send us the link when done.

## Submission Evaluation

Please note that the hiring committee shall evaluate submissions according to the following criteria:

| **Category** | **What We’re Looking For** | Mark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Technical Skills** | Ability to integrate and use the SDK effectively |  |
