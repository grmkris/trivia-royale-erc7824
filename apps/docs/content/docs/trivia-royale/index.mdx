# Trivia Royale Guide

A practical guide for building state channel applications with the Yellow SDK. This documentation is built from real-world experience implementing **Trivia Royale**, a multiplayer trivia game that demonstrates core state channel concepts through working code.

## Core Concepts

Before building with state channels, you need to understand three fundamental concepts:

### The Balance Model

State channels use a 4-layer balance system where funds flow through distinct layers:
- **Wallet Balance** - Your on-chain ETH (starting point)
- **Custody Balance** - Funds deposited to Yellow's smart contract
- **Channel Balance** - Your capacity in a payment channel
- **Ledger Balance** - Allocated funds within application sessions (can be negative)

Understanding this model is critical because different operations require funds in different layers, and withdrawals must traverse all layers in reverse.

### Application Sessions

Sessions are isolated instances where participants interact with instant, gasless transactions. Each session defines:
- Who can participate
- How much each participant stakes
- How funds are distributed when the interaction completes

Sessions enable typed, broadcast messaging between participants and handle fund distribution automatically.

### Message Flow

Clients communicate asynchronously through the ClearNode broker. The architecture:
- ClearNode broadcasts messages to all session participants
- You must handle broadcasting your own messages
- Message ordering and timing affect application behavior
- Typed schemas enable auto-joining and state synchronization

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you're a TypeScript developer with:

- Basic understanding of Web3 concepts (wallets, addresses, signatures)
- Familiarity with async/await patterns
- Experience with event-driven architecture
- Node.js or browser environment setup

You do **not** need deep blockchain knowledge or state channel theory - we'll explain everything as we go.
