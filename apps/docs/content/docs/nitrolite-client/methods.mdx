# Methods

This page provides a complete reference for all methods available in the `NitroliteClient` class from the `@erc7824/nitrolite` package.

## Channel Lifecycle Methods

These methods are organized according to the typical lifecycle of a state channel.

### 1. Deposit Methods

The deposit phase includes methods for managing funds in the custody contract and handling token approvals.

<MethodDetails
  name="deposit"
  description="Deposits tokens or ETH into the custody contract. Automatically handles ERC-20 approval if necessary. This is the first step in the channel lifecycle, as funds must be deposited before channels can be created. Funds deposited are held in a custody contract until they are allocated to channels or withdrawn."
  params={[{ name: "amount", type: "bigint" }]}
  returns="Promise<Hash>"
  example={`await client.deposit(1_000_000_000_000_000_000n);`}
/>

<MethodDetails
  name="approveTokens"
  description="Manually approves the custody contract to spend the specified ERC-20 amount. While the deposit method handles approvals automatically, this method gives developers explicit control over token approvals. This is useful for implementing custom approval UX flows or for batching transactions with other operations."
  params={[{ name: "amount", type: "bigint" }]}
  returns="Promise<Hash>"
  example={`await client.approveTokens(2_000_000n);`}
/>

<MethodDetails
  name="getTokenAllowance"
  description="Gets the current allowance granted to the custody contract for the specified ERC20 token. This is useful for implementing proper UX around approvals, checking if a user needs to approve tokens before depositing, or verifying if existing approvals are sufficient for planned operations."
  returns="Promise<bigint>"
  example={`const allowance = await client.getTokenAllowance();`}
/>

<MethodDetails
  name="getTokenBalance"
  description="Gets the on-chain balance of the specified ERC-20 token for the connected wallet address. This helps developers implement UX that shows users their available token balance before depositing, ensuring they have sufficient funds for the operation. It's particularly useful for validating input amounts in deposit forms."
  returns="Promise<bigint>"
  example={`const balance = await client.getTokenBalance();`}
/>

### 2. Channel Creation Methods

<MethodDetails
  name="createChannel"
  description="Creates a new state channel on-chain. This is a critical step in the Nitrolite workflow that establishes a secure payment channel between two participants. The method handles the complex process of constructing the initial state with proper allocations, signing it, and submitting the transaction to the custody contract. Developers use this to enable high-throughput, low-latency applications with instant payments between participants."
  params={[{ name: "params", type: "CreateChannelParams" }]}
  returns="Promise<{ channelId: ChannelId; initialState: State; txHash: Hash }>"
  example={`await client.createChannel({
    initialAllocationAmounts: [700000n, 300000n], // [host amount, guest amount]
    stateData: '0x1234' // Application-specific data
});`}
/>

<MethodDetails
  name="depositAndCreateChannel"
  description="Combines deposit and channel creation into a single operation, optimizing the user experience by reducing the steps required. This is ideal for applications where users start from scratch without existing deposits. It handles the entire initialization flow: token approval (if needed), depositing funds to the custody contract, and creating the channel. This creates a smoother onboarding process for users who want to start using your application immediately."
  params={[
    { name: "depositAmount", type: "bigint" },
    { name: "params", type: "CreateChannelParams" }
  ]}
  returns="Promise<{ channelId: ChannelId; initialState: State; depositTxHash: Hash; createChannelTxHash: Hash }>"
  example={`await client.depositAndCreateChannel(
    1000000n, // Total amount to deposit
    {
      initialAllocationAmounts: [700000n, 300000n], // Initial channel allocation
      stateData: '0x1234' // Application-specific data
    }
);`}
/>

### 3. Channel Operation Methods

<MethodDetails
  name="checkpointChannel"
  description="Checkpoints a channel state on-chain, creating a permanent on-chain record of the latest state. This is essential for security and dispute resolution, as it provides an immutable record that both parties have agreed to the current channel state. Use this method periodically during long-running channels to minimize risk, before large allocation changes, or when a participant will be offline for extended periods."
  params={[{ name: "params", type: "CheckpointChannelParams" }]}
  returns="Promise<Hash>"
  example={`await client.checkpointChannel({
    channelId, // The ID of the channel to checkpoint
    candidateState // The latest state signed by both parties
});`}
/>

<MethodDetails
  name="challengeChannel"
  description="Initiates a challenge for a channel when the counterparty becomes unresponsive or refuses to cooperate. This is a dispute resolution mechanism that allows a participant to force progress in the channel by submitting their latest signed state. After challenge, the counterparty has a time window (challengeDuration) to respond with a later state, or the challenger's state will be considered final. This method protects users from losing funds due to counterparty unavailability."
  params={[{ name: "params", type: "ChallengeChannelParams" }]}
  returns="Promise<Hash>"
  example={`await client.challengeChannel({
    channelId, // The ID of the channel to challenge
    candidateState // The latest state you have that's signed by both parties
});`}
/>

<MethodDetails
  name="resizeChannel"
  description="Adjusts the total funds allocated to a channel using a new agreed state. This is crucial for dynamic applications where funding requirements change over time. Use this to add more funds to a channel that's running low (top-up), or to reduce the locked funds when less capacity is needed. Resizing requires consensus from both participants and results in an on-chain transaction that updates the channel's total capacity."
  params={[{ name: "params", type: "ResizeChannelParams" }]}
  returns="Promise<Hash>"
  example={`await client.resizeChannel({
  resizeState: {
    channelId,
    stateData: '0x5678',
    allocations: newAllocations,
    version: 2n,
    intent: StateIntent.RESIZE,
    serverSignature: signature
  },
  proofStates: []
});`}
/>

### 4. Channel Closing Methods

<MethodDetails
  name="closeChannel"
  description="Gracefully closes a channel on-chain using a mutually agreed final state. This is the standard way to end a channel when both participants are cooperative. The method submits the final state to the blockchain, which unlocks funds according to the agreed allocations and makes them available for withdrawal. This method should be your go-to approach for ending channels in normal circumstances, as it's gas-efficient and immediately settles the final balances."
  params={[{ name: "params", type: "CloseChannelParams" }]}
  returns="Promise<Hash>"
  example={`await client.closeChannel({
    finalState: {
      channelId, // The ID of the channel to close
      stateData: '0x5678', // Application-specific data
      allocations: [
        { destination: userAddress, token: tokenAddress, amount: 800000n },
        { destination: counterpartyAddress, token: tokenAddress, amount: 200000n }
      ],
      version: 5n, // The latest state version number
      serverSignature: signature // Counterparty's signature of this state
    }
});`}
/>

### 5. Withdrawal Methods

<MethodDetails
  name="withdrawal"
  description="Withdraws tokens previously deposited into the custody contract back to the user's wallet. This allows users to reclaim their funds after channels have been closed. This method only affects available (unlocked) funds - it cannot withdraw tokens that are still locked in active channels. Use this as the final step in the channel lifecycle to complete the full deposit-use-withdraw flow and return funds to the user's control."
  params={[{ name: "amount", type: "bigint" }]}
  returns="Promise<Hash>"
  example={`await client.withdrawal(500000n); // Withdraw 500,000 tokens`}
/>

## Account Information Methods

These methods provide information about your account's state:

<MethodDetails
  name="getAccountChannels"
  description="Retrieves a list of all channel IDs associated with the connected account. This is essential for applications that need to monitor, display, or manage multiple channels simultaneously. Use this to build dashboards showing all user channels, to implement batch operations on multiple channels, or to verify channel existence before performing operations."
  returns="Promise<ChannelId[]>"
  example={`const channels = await client.getAccountChannels();
console.log(\`User has \${channels.length} active channels\`);`}
/>

<MethodDetails
  name="getAccountInfo"
  description="Provides a comprehensive view of the account's financial state within the Nitrolite system. Returns information about available (unlocked) funds, funds locked in active channels, and the total number of channels. This method is crucial for building UIs that show users their current balances and channel activity, for validating that sufficient funds are available before operations, and for monitoring the overall health of the user's Nitrolite account."
  returns="Promise<AccountInfo>"
  example={`const info = await client.getAccountInfo();
console.log(\`Available: \${info.available}, Locked: \${info.locked}, Channels: \${info.channelCount}\`);`}
/>

## Example: Complete Channel Lifecycle

```typescript
import { NitroliteClient } from '@erc7824/nitrolite';

// Initialize the client
const client = new NitroliteClient({
  publicClient,
  walletClient,
  addresses: { custody, adjudicator, guestAddress, tokenAddress },
  chainId: 137,
  challengeDuration: 100n
});

// 1. Deposit funds
const depositTxHash = await client.deposit(1000000n);

// 2. Create a channel
const { channelId, initialState } = await client.createChannel({
  initialAllocationAmounts: [700000n, 300000n],
  stateData: '0x1234'
});

// 3. Get account info to verify funds are locked
const accountInfo = await client.getAccountInfo();
console.log(`Locked in channels: ${accountInfo.locked}`);

// 4. Later, resize the channel
const resizeTxHash = await client.resizeChannel({
  resizeState: {
    channelId,
    stateData: '0x5678',
    allocations: newAllocations,
    version: 2n,
    intent: StateIntent.RESIZE,
    serverSignature: signature
  },
  proofStates: []
});

// 5. Close the channel
const closeTxHash = await client.closeChannel({
  finalState: {
    channelId,
    stateData: '0x5678',
    allocations: [
      { destination: userAddress, token: tokenAddress, amount: 800000n },
      { destination: counterpartyAddress, token: tokenAddress, amount: 200000n }
    ],
    version: 5n,
    serverSignature: signature
  }
});

// 6. Withdraw funds
const withdrawTxHash = await client.withdrawal(800000n);
```
