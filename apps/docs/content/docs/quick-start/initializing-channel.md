# Create a Channel

Before you can start building with Nitrolite, you need to create a channel from your account. This is done through [apps.yellow.com](https://apps.yellow.com), similar to how you would set up an app in other development platforms.

## Getting Started

To get started, visit [apps.yellow.com](https://apps.yellow.com) and create an account. You can use the platform to manage your apps, configurations, channels, and more.


## Creating Your First Channel

1. **Sign up or log in** to [apps.yellow.com](https://apps.yellow.com)
2. **Navigate to your channels** where you can manage them
3. **Create a new channel** by clicking the appropriate button

That's it! After creating your channel, you can start building your app with your business logic. You don't need to worry about channel credentials - the ClearNode will handle channel identification automatically when you connect.

## Channel Configuration

When creating a channel, you'll be able to configure:

- **Channel name and description** for easy identification
- **Application settings** specific to your use case
- **Access permissions** and participant management
- **Integration settings** for your development environment

## Next Steps

Once your channel is created at [apps.yellow.com](https://apps.yellow.com), you're ready to:

1. **[Start building your App](connect_to_the_clearnode)** - Connect to ClearNode and begin development
2. **[Create application sessions](application_session)** to implement your business logic
