# Patterns & Examples

These are **complete, working applications** that demonstrate Yellow SDK patterns in real code. Each example builds on the concepts from Core Concepts and Building Blocks sections.

## The Examples

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Simple Payment"
    description="The absolute simplest: deposit → send → withdraw. No sessions required."
    href="/trivia-royale/patterns/simple-payment"
  />
  <Card
    title="Ping-Pong Session"
    description="Your first session with typed messages and event handlers"
    href="/trivia-royale/patterns/ping-pong"
  />
  <Card
    title="Complete Game"
    description="Full Trivia Royale: 3 players, distributed sessions, prize distribution"
    href="/trivia-royale/patterns/complete-game"
  />
  <Card
    title="Error Handling"
    description="Common issues and proven recovery strategies"
    href="/trivia-royale/patterns/error-handling"
  />
</Cards>

## Progression

### Level 1: Simple Payment
**Complexity**: ⭐☆☆☆☆
**Concepts**: Fund management only
**Use for**: Understanding balances and transfers

### Level 2: Ping-Pong
**Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆
**Concepts**: Sessions, typed messages, event handlers
**Use for**: Learning session basics

### Level 3: Complete Game
**Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Concepts**: Everything!
**Use for**: Real multiplayer applications

## What You'll Learn

From these examples, you'll see:

✅ **Fund flows** from deposit through gameplay to withdrawal
✅ **Distributed signing** for trustless multi-party coordination
✅ **Message broadcasting** and handler patterns
✅ **Balance verification** and fund conservation
✅ **Session lifecycle** management
✅ **Error handling** for production robustness

## Next Steps

After studying these patterns:
- Adapt them for your use case
- Reference **[Building Blocks](/trivia-royale/building-blocks)** for specific techniques
- Review **[Core Concepts](/trivia-royale/core-concepts)** if something is unclear
