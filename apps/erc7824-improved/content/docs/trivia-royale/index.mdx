# Trivia Royale Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for building state channel applications with the Yellow SDK. This documentation is built from real-world experience implementing **Trivia Royale**, a multiplayer trivia game that demonstrates all core concepts of state channels.

## Why This Guide Exists

The official Yellow SDK documentation covers the low-level protocol details, but many developers struggle with:

- **Understanding the balance model** - Why are there 4 different balance types?
- **Fund management** - How do I move money between wallet, custody, channel, and ledger?
- **Distributed sessions** - How do multiple parties coordinate to create a session?
- **Message patterns** - What's the best way to structure typed messages?
- **Complete flows** - What does a real application look like end-to-end?

This guide answers those questions with **practical patterns extracted from production code**.

## Learning Path

We recommend following this order:

### 1. Core Concepts

Start here to understand the fundamental architecture before writing code:

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll understand:

✅ **The 4-layer balance system** and how value flows between them
✅ **When to use resize vs allocate** operations
✅ **How to coordinate multiple participants** to create sessions
✅ **Type-safe message schemas** for robust applications
✅ **Complete fund lifecycle** from deposit to prize distribution
✅ **Balance verification** and fund conservation principles
✅ **Error handling** for connection drops and insufficient funds
✅ **Testing strategies** for state channel applications

## Code First Philosophy

This guide prioritizes **working code over abstract theory**. Every concept is demonstrated with:

- Real TypeScript code from the Trivia Royale implementation
- Visual diagrams showing data flow
- Balance checks at each step
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you're a TypeScript developer with:

- Basic understanding of Web3 concepts (wallets, addresses, signatures)
- Familiarity with async/await patterns
- Experience with event-driven architecture
- Node.js or browser environment setup

You do **not** need deep blockchain knowledge or state channel theory - we'll explain everything as we go.
