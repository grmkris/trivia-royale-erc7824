# Building Blocks

Now that you understand the core concepts, these guides show you **how to implement common patterns** in your applications. Each building block is a standalone technique you'll use repeatedly.

## The Essential Patterns

## When to Use Each

### Fund Management
**Use when**: Moving value in or out of the system
- Initial user onboarding (deposit)
- Cashing out winnings (withdraw)
- Rebalancing channel capacity
- Peer-to-peer payments

### Distributed Sessions
**Use when**: Creating multi-party applications
- Multiplayer games
- Multi-party contracts
- Collaborative applications
- Tournament brackets

### Typed Messaging
**Use when**: Defining application communication
- Any session-based application
- Real-time games
- Chat applications
- Auction systems

### Session Lifecycle
**Use when**: Managing application state
- Tracking active games/sessions
- Cleaning up after completion
- Handling disconnections
- Managing UI state

## Learning Path

If you're building a **simple payment app**, focus on:
1. Fund Management
2. (Skip sessions)

If you're building a **peer-to-peer game**, focus on:
1. Fund Management (to get funds in)
2. Distributed Sessions (to coordinate players)
3. Typed Messaging (for game logic)
4. Session Lifecycle (for cleanup)

If you're building a **multiplayer server-authoritative game**, focus on:
1. Fund Management
2. Distributed Sessions
3. Typed Messaging
4. Session Lifecycle

## Next Steps

After mastering the building blocks, see them in action:
- **[Simple Payment](../patterns/simple-payment)**: Fund management only
- **[Ping-Pong](../patterns/ping-pong)**: Sessions + messaging
- **[Complete Game](../patterns/complete-game)**: All patterns together
