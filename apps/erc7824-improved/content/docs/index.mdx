# Introduction

Welcome to Nitrolite! Built on the ERC-7824 standard, Nitrolite is a powerful framework that enables developers to build high-performance decentralized applications with near-instant finality.

The following guides will walk you through the complete lifecycle of Nitrolite applications, from client initialization to application sessions. Whether you're building payment systems, games, financial applications, or any use case requiring high-frequency transactions, Nitrolite provides the infrastructure you need.

## Key Features

- **Instant Transactions**: Off-chain operations mean no waiting for block confirmations.
- **Minimal Gas Fees**: On-chain gas is primarily for channel opening and settlement.
- **High Throughput**: Capable of handling thousands of transactions per second.
- **Application Flexibility**: Ideal for games, payment systems, real-time interactions, and more.

## Core SDK Architecture

The Nitrolite SDK is designed with modularity and broad compatibility in mind:

1. **NitroliteClient**: This is the main entry point for developers. It provides a high-level API to manage the lifecycle of state channels, including deposits, channel creation, application session management, and withdrawals.

2. **Nitrolite RPC**: This component handles the secure, real-time, off-chain communication between channel participants and the broker. It's responsible for message signing, verification, and routing.
